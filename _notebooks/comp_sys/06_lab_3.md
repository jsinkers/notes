- meaning of HTTP headers

- how many bytes to implement this page?

- what is each request for?
  - GET requests to get HTML, images, ad services, javascript
  - POST request to beacon
- response status codes
  - `200`: successful
  - `302`: resource temporarily moved (redirects)

- which ones are cacheable?
  - GET, HEAD, and POST can be cached (in general)
  - `Cache-Control` header holds instructions for caching, and can be in both
    requests and responses.  Some examples from the page:
    - `Cache-Control: private`: response is for a single user and mustn't be stored
      by a shared cache, but can be stored by private cache e.g. browser cache
    - `Cache-Control: no-store`: don't store anything
